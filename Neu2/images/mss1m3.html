<p><h1>MODULE 3:</h1></P>
	<p><h2>OBJECTIVES:</h2></p>

<p>1.3.1 Identify the spinal cord, conus medullaris, and the cauda equina. Identify the major coverings (meninges) of the spinal cord. Indicate the relationship of the meninges to the vertebral canal, cerebral spinal fluid, nerve roots and spinal cord.</p>
<p>1.3.2 Identify the components of a typical spinal nerve including sensory and motor portions, ventral rami, dorsal root ganglia, and demonstrate the parts of a typical spinal nerve that contain components of the visceral nervous system.</p>
<p><h2>READINGS:</h2> Gray's Anatomy Pages 99-110. See Green highlighted sections for clinical correlation.</p>
<p><h2>SECTRA TABLE WORK:</h2></p>

		<li><p>Using the figure of the spinal column, discuss the spinal nerves with respect to their origin from the vertebral column.</p></li>
		<p>QUESTION: How many cervical vertebrae are there? ANS: Seven</p>
		<p>QUESTION: How many cervical nerves are there? ANS: Eight</p>
		<p>QUESTION: Why is there an discrepancy between the number of vertebrae and the number of nerves? For the first 7 vertebrae the nerves exit cephlad (superior) to the vertebrae. From thoracic vertebra TI through the remainder of the spinal column, the nerves exit inferiorly. Cervical nerve CVIII exits inferior to cerical vertebrae CVII and allows for the pattern of one skeletal nerve per intervertebral space.</p>
		<li><p>On the sagittal plane, locate the Spinal Cord, Conus Medullaris and Cauda Equina.</p></li>

		<p>QUESTION: At what vertebral level are you on this transvere plane? ANS: TI</p>
		<li><p>Use the accompanying diagrams to help understand the relationship of the meninges with the nerve roots. Adjust the transverse plane until you have seen the thoracic, lumbar and sacral areas of the spine with respect to the nerve roots.</p></li>

		<li><p>Using the draw tool, identify the following spinal coverings on the current transverse plane:</p></li>
		<p>Dura mater</p>
		<p>Arachnoid mater</p>
		<p>Subarachnoid space</p>
		<p>Pia mater</p>
		
		<li><p>Adjust the transverse plane to mimic the lumbar and the sacral cross sections. </p></li>

		<li><p>Add: <a href="https://www.vhdissector.com/share/3tmg9r" >Spinal gangions</a></p></li>
		
		<li><p>Using the following drawings, identify the components of the sensory nervous system using the drawing tool. Please note that these drawings were taken from your Neuroanatomy book. Neurologists use the terms Ventral and Dorsal. These are embryologic terms but mean the same as Anterior=Ventral and Posteror=Dorsal. </p></li>
		<p>Ventral horn</p>
		<p>Dorsal horn</p>
		<p>Ventral root</p>
		<p>Dorsal root</p>
		<p>Dorsal rooot ganglia</p>
		
		<li><p>Discuss the relationship of the motor and sympathetic nerves within the thoracic spinal nerves.</p></li>

		<p><img src="images/Transmitter.jpg" alt="HTML" width="200" height="92" class="flowLeft" ></p>
		<p><img src="images/Sympathetic.jpg" alt="HTML" width="500" height="363" class="flowLeft" ></p>
		
		<p>Note that Somatic efferent nerves have no ganglion involvemet. However, sympathetic efferents involve a gangion and therefore have pre and post ganglionic components. You will learn more about the significance of this throughout your courses and in your neuroanatomy course in the fall of your second year. </p>

						<td>Sternoclavicular Joint - It is a diarthrodial joint that is the only connection between the upper extremity and the trunk.  The proximal end of the clavicle articulates with the manubrium of the sternum.  The two articulating surfaces are saddle shape. Congruence and stability of the two surfaces is improved by an intraarticular disc.  It is a fibrocartilage disk that acts to absorb stress and strain around the joint. There is a weak joint capsule around the joint that is reinforced by the anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments.</td>

					<tr>
						<td>Anterior sternoclavicular ligament- it is the strongest of the two ligaments, probably because it is reinforced with the tendon of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments prevent upward displacement of the medial clavicle as well as inferior displacement of the lateral clavicle.  This is because the fibers of the ligament run superiorly from the attachment on the sternum to insert on the superior aspect of the clavicle. There is also an interclavicular ligament that passes from the superiomedial aspect of each clavicle to attach on the upper border of the manubrium.  Helps resist superior translation of the clavicle.</td>

Posterior dislocations are considered a medical emergency because of the potential impingement of the mediastinal and cervical structures that run in this area.  Compression of the trachea and/or esophagus is also a potential serious complication of a posterior dislocation.</td>

It acts as a counter balance to the pulling forces placed on the coracoid process by the pectoralis minor and coracobrachialis muscles.  The most significant role this ligament seems to play is in the pathology of impingement syndrome.  This ligament forms the “roof” of the shoulder and has been implicated as one of the primary players in subacromial bursitis and rotator cuff tendonitis.</td>

The scapulothoracic articulation contributes largely to the overall range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder, as we will see later.  The movement of the scapulothoracic articulation along with the glenohumeral joint in contributing to shoulder ROM has been termed the “scapulohumeral rhythm.  Scapulothoracic rotation contributes approximately 60&#176 of motion out of the 180&#176 of motion available at the shoulder</td>
